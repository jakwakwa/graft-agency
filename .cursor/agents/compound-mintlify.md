# /compound

Coordinate multiple subagents working in parallel to document a recently solved problem.

## Purpose

Captures problem solutions while context is fresh, creating structured documentation in `docs/issues/` with YAML frontmatter for searchability and future reference. Uses parallel subagents for maximum efficiency.

**Why "compound"?** Each documented solution compounds our team's knowledge. The first time you solve a problem takes research. Document it, and the next occurrence takes minutes. Knowledge compounds.

## Usage

```bash
/workflows:compound                    # Document the most recent fix
/workflows:compound [brief context]    # Provide additional context hint
```

## Execution Strategy: Multi-Phase Orchestration

<critical_requirement>
**Only ONE file gets written - the final documentation.**

Phase 1 subagents return TEXT DATA to the orchestrator. They must NOT use Write, Edit, or create any files. Only the orchestrator (Phase 2) writes the final documentation file.
</critical_requirement>

<critical_requirement>
**Phase 4 (ClickUp wiki) is mandatory** whenever the **`user-clickup`** MCP is available. Do **not** ask the user whether to sync to ClickUp after the workflow; run the **`clickup-wiki-stratcol`** subagent as part of this command. If the MCP is unavailable, report that the wiki step was skipped and include verbatim errors.
</critical_requirement>

### Phase 1: Parallel Research

<parallel_tasks>

Launch these subagents IN PARALLEL. Each returns text data to the orchestrator.

#### 1. **Context Analyzer**
   - Extracts conversation history
   - Identifies problem type, component, symptoms
   - Validates against schema
   - Returns: YAML frontmatter skeleton

#### 2. **Solution Extractor**
   - Analyzes all investigation steps
   - Identifies root cause
   - Extracts working solution with code examples
   - Returns: Solution content block

#### 3. **Related Docs Finder**
   - Searches `docs/issues/` for related documentation
   - Identifies cross-references and links
   - Finds related GitHub issues
   - Returns: Links and relationships

#### 4. **Prevention Strategist**
   - Develops prevention strategies
   - Creates best practices guidance
   - Generates test cases if applicable
   - Returns: Prevention/testing content

#### 5. **Category Classifier**
   - Determines optimal `docs/issues/` category
   - Validates category against schema
   - Suggests filename based on slug
   - Returns: Final path and filename

</parallel_tasks>

### Phase 2: Assembly & Write

<sequential_tasks>

**WAIT for all Phase 1 subagents to complete before proceeding.**

The orchestrating agent (main conversation) performs these steps:

1. Collect all text results from Phase 1 subagents
2. Assemble complete markdown file from the collected pieces
3. Validate YAML frontmatter against schema
4. Create directory if needed: `mkdir -p docs/issues/[category]/`
5. Write the SINGLE final file: `docs/issues/[category]/[filename].mdx`

</sequential_tasks>

### Phase 3: Optional Enhancement

**WAIT for Phase 2 to complete before proceeding.**

<parallel_tasks>

Based on problem type, optionally invoke specialized agents to review the documentation:

- **performance_issue** → `performance-oracle`
- **database_issue** → `data-integrity-guardian`
- **inngest_issue** → `inngest-contracts` and `inngest-runtime` subagents
- Any code-heavy issue → `kieran-rails-reviewer` + `code-simplicity-reviewer`

If any reviewer feedback is **applied to the documentation file**, treat that version as the **final** body for Phase 4.

</parallel_tasks>

### Phase 4: StratCol AI Wiki (mandatory)

**WAIT for Phase 2 to complete before proceeding.** If Phase 3 ran and the orchestrator **edited** the written file, **WAIT for those edits** before this phase.

<sequential_tasks>

1. Read the **final** markdown from the path written in Phase 2 (after any Phase 3 edits).
2. Invoke the **`clickup-wiki-stratcol`** subagent (Task tool) with: finalized **content** (or path + contents), **page title** derived from the doc, and a **source** line (`Source: docs/issues/...`).
3. Do **not** prompt “Sync to ClickUp?” — publishing under **Control Tower: Overview → Issues** is part of `/compound-mintlify` when MCP works.
4. If **`user-clickup`** is unavailable or the subagent errors, report the failure explicitly; do not pretend the wiki step succeeded.

</sequential_tasks>

## What It Captures

- **Problem symptom**: Exact error messages, observable behavior
- **Investigation steps tried**: What didn't work and why
- **Root cause analysis**: Technical explanation
- **Working solution**: Step-by-step fix with code examples
- **Prevention strategies**: How to avoid in future
- **Cross-references**: Links to related issues and docs

## Preconditions

<preconditions enforcement="advisory">
  <check condition="problem_solved">
    Problem has been solved (not in-progress)
  </check>
  <check condition="solution_verified">
    Solution has been verified working
  </check>
  <check condition="non_trivial">
    Non-trivial problem (not simple typo or obvious error)
  </check>
</preconditions>

## What It Creates

**Organized documentation:**

- File: `docs/issues/[category]/[filename].md`

**Categories auto-detected from problem:**

- build-errors/
- test-failures/
- runtime-errors/
- performance-issues/
- database-issues/
- security-issues/
- ui-bugs/
- integration-issues/
- logic-errors/

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

| ❌ Wrong | ✅ Correct |
|----------|-----------|
| Subagents write files like `context-analysis.md`, `solution-draft.md` | Subagents return text data; orchestrator writes one final file |
| Research and assembly run in parallel | Research completes → then assembly runs |
| Multiple files created during workflow | Single file: `docs/issues/[category]/[filename].md` |
| Asking “Sync to ClickUp?” after the run | Phase 4 runs **`clickup-wiki-stratcol`** automatically when MCP is available |

## The Compounding Philosophy

This creates a compounding knowledge system:

1. First time you solve "N+1 query in brief generation" → Research (30 min)
2. Document the solution → docs/issues/performance-issues/n-plus-one-briefs.md (5 min)
3. Next time similar issue occurs → Quick lookup (2 min)
4. Knowledge compounds → Team gets smarter

The feedback loop:

```
Build → Test → Find Issue → Research → Improve → Document → Validate → Deploy
    ↑                                                                      ↓
    └──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Each unit of engineering work should make subsequent units of work easier—not harder.**

## Auto-Invoke

<auto_invoke> <trigger_phrases> - "that worked" - "it's fixed" - "working now" - "problem solved" </trigger_phrases>

<manual_override> Use /commands:compound-mintlify [context] to document immediately without waiting for auto-detection. </manual_override> </auto_invoke>

## Routes To

`compound-docs` skill

## Applicable Specialized Agents

Based on problem type, these agents can enhance documentation:

### Code Quality & Review
- **kieran-rails-reviewer**: Reviews code examples for Rails best practices
- **code-simplicity-reviewer**: Ensures solution code is minimal and clear
- **pattern-recognition-specialist**: Identifies anti-patterns or repeating issues

### Specific Domain Experts
- **performance-oracle**: Analyzes performance_issue category solutions
- **security-sentinel**: Reviews security_issue solutions for vulnerabilities
- **jaco-test-reviewer**: Creates test cases for prevention strategies
- **data-integrity-guardian**: Reviews database_issue migrations and queries

### Enhancement & Documentation
- **best-practices-researcher**: Enriches solution with industry best practices
- **mitlify-style-editor**: Reviews documentation style and clarity

### When to Invoke
- **Auto-triggered** (optional): Agents can run post-documentation for enhancement
- **Manual trigger**: User can invoke agents after /workflows:compound completes for deeper review

### Wiki publish (always with this workflow)
- **`clickup-wiki-stratcol`**: Invoked in **Phase 4** after the doc file is final — not optional when **`user-clickup`** MCP is available (see Phase 4 above).

## Related Commands
